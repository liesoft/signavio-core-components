# Signavio Core Components: Creating BPMN 2.0 diagrams #

BPMN 2.0 is an exciting standard for business process modeling and execution. The process diagrams you create graphically can be loaded into process engines - thanks to the standardized XML interchange format. The Signavio Core Components enable the basic creation and interchange of BPMN 2.0 diagrams. There is a lightweight file-based backend included in the repository.

The Signavio Core Components project contains the technical foundations for editing process diagrams.
